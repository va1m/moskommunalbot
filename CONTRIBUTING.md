# Contributing

If you want to contribute to the project, just follow these simple steps:

1. Fork main branch into your's repository
2. Put your changes in a single commit
3. Write a clear commit message which should answer on two questions: _what?_ and _why?_.
   If your commit implements any opened issue (https://github.com/va1m/moskommunalbot/issues), mention the issue number at the very last line of your commit message. Like this:
   ```
   Implement aborting process

   For the case when user's made a mistake entering meter values or just wants to start a new calculation

   #8
   ```
4. Create a pull request with description duplicating the commit message. The destination branch should be this repo's `main` branch.

Happy coding!
